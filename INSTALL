BASILISK II INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS
=====================================

System Requirements
-------------------

To use Basilisk II, you need either a 512K Mac Classic ROM image or a
512K or 1MB 32-bit clean Macintosh ROM image. You also need a copy of MacOS
(0.x thru 7.5 for Classic emulation, 7.x or 8.0/8.1 for Mac II emulation).
For copyright reasons, none of these items are included with Basilisk II.
MacOS 7.5.3 and earlier versions can be downloaded from Apple and various
other Internet sites. Mac ROM files are not freely available. You have to
own a real Mac and read out its ROM. No, I don't know where you can download
ROM files. No, I won't send you one.

Depending on the platform you use, Basilisk II has additional requirements:

BeOS:
  You need BeOS R4 or later versions.
  Basilisk II cannot do Mac Classic emulation.

Unix:
  You need X11R6 and a "make" utility with the VPATH feature (e.g. GNU make).
  For serial, ethernet and audio support, you need pthreads. To use the GUI
  preferences editor, you also need GTK+ version 1.2 or better. On Linux, you
  need glibc 2.0 or better.

AmigaOS:
  You need at least a 68020 and AmigaOS 3.0 or better. To get the GUI
  preferences editor, you need gtlayout.library V39 or later. To get sound
  output, you need AHI V2 or later. Both items can be found on Aminet. You
  also need the "PrepareEmul" utility that somes with ShapeShifter (or any
  equivalent PrepareEmul substitute). The AmigaOS version of Basilisk II
  cannot do Mac Classic emulation.

Windows:
  You need at least Windows NT 4.0. Windows 95 and 98 can be used too, with a
  somewhat reduced set of features. Basilisk II supports DirectX version 5 or
  later, but version 3 may also work, depending on your graphics card.

Mac OS X:
  Versions 10.0 thru 10.2 can be used, and 10.3 will probably be no problem.
  (OS X public beta is not supported by the current executable or source code,
   but if you really need to use it, I can provide versions that will work)

Installation
------------

BeOS:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for BeOS, there are
  executables for BeOS/PPC and/or BeOS/x86 included. Basilisk II cannot run
  concurrently with SheepShaver. Trying to do so will crash Basilisk II, or
  SheepShaver, or both.

  If you have the source distribution, do the following:

    cd src/BeOS
    make

  This will produce an executable "BasiliskII" in the "obj.ppc" or "obj.x86"
  directory. To use Ethernet, you also have to do:

    cd SheepNet
    make install

  On a PowerPC system, you also have to do:

    cd SheepDriver
    make install

Unix:
  To compile Basilisk II, do the following:

    cd src/Unix
    ./configure
    make            [or "gmake" if you have GNU make and "make" fails]
    make install    [optionally]

  To use Ethernet networking under Linux, you either have to configure your
  kernel for ethertap support or make and install the "sheep_net" driver
  (this is explained in the README file, at the description of the "ether"
  preferences item).

  This is what Brian J. Johnson says about compiling for IRIX:
   "I recommend compiling with "-Ofast".  This requires changing "-g"
    to "-Ofast" in the Makefile, and adding "-ipa" to LDFLAGS.  This
    turns on massive interprocedural optimization, and makes for much
    better performance."

  ATTENTION NetBSD/m68k USERS:
  If you want to run Basilisk II natively (i.e. without CPU emulation), you
  must NOT use a pthreads library. User-level threads libraries such as PTL
  interfere with the signal handlers installed by Basilisk II and kernel-
  level threads are not supported by NetBSD, so you will have to live without
  pthreads, and thus without serial/ethernet/audio support (but the "UDP
  tunnelling" network should work).

  ATTENTION NetBSD/mac68k USERS:
  Current (as of July 2000) versions of the NetBSD/mac68k kernel have a bug
  that not only prevents Basilisk II from running properly but seems to even
  cause kernel panics under certain conditions! Apply the following patch to
  /sys/arch/mac68k/mac68k/macromasm.s, recompile and re-install the kernel
  and reboot before using Basilisk II:

AmigaOS:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for AmigaOS, there is an
  executable included. You must also have the "PrepareEmul" utility installed
  that comes with ShapeShifter (or any equivalent PrepareEmul substitute,
  see the ShapeShifter docs). If you have the source distribution, do the
  following:

    cd src/AmigaOS
    make

  To recompile Basilisk II, you need the GeekGadgets development suite and
  PhxAss (which can be found on Aminet).

Windows NT:
  If you have a binary distribution of Basilisk II for Windows, there is a
  Windows NT binary included. To access CD-ROMs under Windows NT, the driver
  "cdenable.sys" must be copied to your "\WinNT\System32\drivers" directory.
  To access CD-ROMs under Windows 9x, the driver "cdenable.vxd" must be copied
  to the "\Windows\System" directory. To recompile Basilisk II, you need
  MS Visual V++ 5.0 or later. Symantec C++ should work, too, with some
  modifications. See the "sysdeps.h" file in the "Windows" directory.

Mac OS X:
  If you have the prebuilt application, there is nothing to do.
  If you have the developer tools installed, and want to built it yourself,
  look in the file src/MacOSX/0_HOW_TO_BUILD.txt


The ROM file has to be named "ROM" and put in the same directory as the
Basilisk II executable but you can specify a different location for the ROM
file with the "rom" option in the preferences file (or with the preferences
GUI).
