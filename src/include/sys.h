 *  These routines are used for reading from and writing to disk files
 *  or devices in sony.cpp, disk.cpp and cdrom.cpp. Their purpose is to
 *  hide all OS-specific details of file and device access. The routines
 *  must also hide all restrictions on the location or alignment of the
 *  data buffer or on the transfer length that may be imposed by the
 *  underlying OS.
 *  A file/device is identified by a "filename" (character string) that
 *  may (but need not) map to a valid file path. After Sys_open(), the
 *  file/device is identified by an abstract "file handle" (void *),
 *  that is freed by Sys_close().
